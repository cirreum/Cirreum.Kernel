	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// Resolution prefers the Entra <c>oid</c> (object identifier) claim when present, falling

	/// <para>
	/// This value is immutable for the lifetime of the user's identity in the IdP and is used
	/// as the external identifier on <see cref="IApplicationUser"/> — the lookup key passed to
